# Automated Data Scraping for Hockey Teams and Oscar-Winning Films 

## Project Title
Automated Data Scraping and Curation for Sports and Entertainment

## Description
This project automates the extraction and curation of data from two sources:
1. **Hockey Teams:** Scraping multiple pages of hockey team data, calculating win rates below 40%, and storing the results in a JSON file.
2. **Oscar-Winning Films:** Scraping Oscar-winning films for multiple years, collecting details like nominations, awards, and determining whether they won the "Best Picture" award.

### Key Features
- Extracts hockey team data from four pages and stores it in JSON format with fields such as team name, year, win percentage, and epoch time of scrape.
- Scrapes Oscar-winning films, including the title, nominations, awards, winner status, and year of data scrape.
- Outputs the curated data as JSON files in a structured format.
- Verifies the existence and content of the generated JSON files using TestNG assertions.
- Uses wrapper methods to ensure robust handling of Selenium interactions.
- Includes mechanisms to handle CAPTCHA requirements during automation.
